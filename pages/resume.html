        <li>Chairman of the board</li>
        <li>As Chairman of the Board at Google, I provided strategic leadership and oversight, guiding the company in setting long-term goals and aligning them with its core mission of innovation. I led the Board of Directors in establishing corporate policies, ensuring robust corporate governance, and maintaining compliance with legal and ethical standards. In my role, I acted as the primary liaison between executive leadership and key stakeholders, including shareholders, investors, and partners. I offered counsel to the CEO and senior management team on critical decisions related to acquisitions, investments, and overall market positioning. Additionally, I played a key role in fostering a culture of innovation within the company, supporting initiatives that kept Google at the forefront of technological advancements. I also ensured that the company remained vigilant in identifying and mitigating risks, including those related to technology, market trends, and regulatory challenges. Through my leadership, I represented Google in high-level public engagements, negotiations, and investor relations events, helping to strengthen the company’s vision and business success.</li>
